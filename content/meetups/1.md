## ⚛️ React updates ⚛️

### [Algebraic Effects for the Rest of Us](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/) 

Intuitively introduces algebraic effects, which invites us to think more thoroughly about effect handling in a perform - resume process, feels like try catch but more powerful! Presumptuous ES2025 proposal 😈

### Gatsby officially released [Gatsby Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) 

...this month, and there's a [Gatsby Theme JAM](https://themejam.gatsbyjs.org/) contest that is ending July 31st, and there are [many](https://amsterdam.netlify.com/) [interesting](https://gatsby-theme-minimal.netlify.com/) [themes](https://github.com/vojtaholik/gatsby-theme-simplecast) emerged

### [Hermes Engine](https://hermesengine.dev/) was born

[Chain React](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf) happened July 12, [Hermes was released](https://hermesengine.dev/), its doc site is using Docusaurus 2, [got only 1 page and yet has a dark light toggle](https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/1149386753012191232?s=20) (I'm sure @kenlsm has more interesting things to say about this)
